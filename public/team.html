                        can be and challenges students face. From striving to improve your university experience
                        during her time as a Resident Advisor, to using her platform as Active Minds co-president and
                        to
                        advocate for improved mental health supports and ensure that all students feel safe and
                        welcomed here on campus- she has always been consistent in her desire for improving the
                        lives of her fellow students. By re-electing her as VP Advocacy, she will take her extensive
                        experience working with students and use it to elevate your voice and hear your concerns to
                        ensure that your university experience is a positive one. When Sarah isnt in the boardroom
                        fighting for students, you can find her in her natural habitat: kicking back somewhere in
                        nature
                        with her dog, Sasha or sipping on a cup of dark roast, rattling off bad dad-jokes.</h3>
