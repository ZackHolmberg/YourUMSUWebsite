                    <h3><strong>Demand Better And Give Students A Vote To Leave CFS</strong><br>
                        Since joining the Canadian Federation of Students, UMSU members have paid them over $4
                        million. For that price, students deserve an organization that is effective and accountable.
                        Your
                        UMSU believes you should choose where your money goes and that is why we will give
                        students a vote on continued membership. If UMSU decertifies, we will present students with an
                        opportunity to use that money to join another federal advocacy organization and work
                        collaboratively with all provincial student unions - those in and out of CFS - to form a
                        provincial
                        lobbying organization including all Manitoba students for the first time.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Increased Research Employment Opportunities For Students</strong><br>
                        Your UMSU ready to take advocacy to the next level by employing our best resource; you! We
                        will create a student research jobs program, you can apply for a student research grant though
                        UMSU, where you will be paid a living wage, gain meaningful on campus employment, and
                        shape UMSU’s advocacy priorities. We will also advocate to the federal government to expand
                        the Undergraduate Student Research Award program to social sciences and health research.
                        Last but not least, we will highlight two student researchers each week on our TVs and social
                        media, including at least one outstanding Indigenous student scholar.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Make The University of Manitoba The Destination For Indigenous Education</strong><br>
                        Located on Treaty 1 Land and housing the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, the
                        University of Manitoba should be the flagship University for Indigenous Scholarship. Your
                        UMSU will create an Indigenous Scholar hiring fund, where UMSU’s endowment fund will match
                        contributions made by the university and the province to provide funding for Indigenous
                        instructors. This will ensure that the UofM will offer an Indigenous Language major with
                        streams
                        in Anishinabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, Dene, Inuktitut and Michif. We will also lobby the
                        university to increase Indigenous course content and Indigenous scholars in all programs.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Make The UofM And UMSU Leaders In Environmental Sustainability</strong><br>
                        It is integral that the University of Manitoba takes a leadership role in promoting
                        environmental
                        sustainability. That is we will work with the university to mplement a campus-wide composting
                        program, and incorporate sustainability focused course options and work/study options in all
                        programs. Looking internally, your UMSU will Implement the recommendations of the UMSU
                        Sustainability Working Group that your UMSU President founded this year, including a green
                        events guide, and more accessible composting in our businesses.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Fight For Affordable Education</strong><br>
                        It is no secret that University is getting more expensive. To fight back, we need experienced
                        leaders with bold and tangible ideas. In addition to mobilizing students against a second
                        straight
                        year of maximum allowable tuition increases, UMSU will build upon this year’s advancements
                        such as increased Open Educational Resources (OERs) in classes and keeping interest off
                        student loans. This year, we will lobby for increased upfront grants, while broadening the
                        access
                        pool to include part time students. As well, we will continue to bring in more affordable
                        classroom materials for students by starting a university wide OER working group with faculty,
                        administration and students, and lobby government to create grant funding for OER creators.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Create More Choice And Opportunity With Your UPass</strong><br>
                        This is our final year in our current UPass contract, and while many students have enjoyed this
                        access to affordable transit service, it currently does not include the summer semester. Having
                        led preliminary negotiations with Winnipeg Transit this year, your UMSU President will present
                        students with the option of a summer UPass in our next contract. Additionally, we will ensure
                        all
                        students living outside the transit service area can opt out of the UPass program.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Expanded Campus Safety Initiatives</strong><br>
                        Sexual violence is a pressing issue - especially here on campus, and we want to ensure that
                        students feel safe and survivors are put first; this is why my team and I will work with the
                        University to implement a Sexual Violence Support and Resource Centre that will act as central
                        hub for both and education and essential services. As well, we will advocate for our faculty
                        and
                        staff to have increased education and training in areas such as diversity and disclosure
                        training
                        , in order to better support our student body. Specifically, Your UMSU will push to ensure
                        there
                        is an increased focus on Indigenous education and having this embedded in any and all training
                        offered. Moreover, our team will see to that more students, particularly new students, are
                        trained
                        in available supports, sexual violence basics and procedures via new student orientation.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Improved Access To Mental Health Supports & Accommodations</strong><br>
                        Five in five students have mental health, but with education costs rising, limited Financial
                        Aid
                        options alongside the everyday stress of being a University student, it's not surprising that
                        students
                        with mental health problems and illnesses have some of the highest non-completion rates of all
                        post-secondary students. My team and I will ensure that students are getting timely and proper
                        supports and accommodations by advocating to all levels of government to increase funding for
                        existing and new mental health initiatives, supports and accessibility tools for students.
                        Moreover, Your UMSU will lobby for changes to the Canadian Student Loans Program (CSLP)
                        to ensure that its definition of ‘permanent disabilities’ reflects and responds to the diverse
                        situations of students, including the accommodation needs of students with mental health
                        problems and illnesses.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Increase Safety & Reduce Costs Of On-Campus Socials</strong><br>Your UMSU is committed
                        to
                        ensuring that students enjoy their university experience and stay
                        safe while doing so - this is why our team will continue to work with the University to offset
                        costs
                        associated with newly implemented Police Presence requirement by introducing incentivization
                        mechanisms wherein the more proactive and preventive measures a student group or
                        association has in place for their social, the less time (and money) spent on and the more time
                        you can focus on having fun in a safe environment.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Establish More Family Friendly Spaces On Bannatyne And Fort Garry Campuses</strong><br>
                        Students come from all walks of life and all face different challenges. No matter what your
                        needs are, your UMSU should have the proper supports. That’s why we will work with the
                        University to implement a Daycare program on Bannatyne campus, with reserved spots for
                        Indigenous students and accessible to inner city students so all our members can access
                        quality, accessible child care. As well, we will increase the number of breastfeeding friendly
                        spaces on all campuses to ensure that we are a family friendly University.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Womyns Equity & Inclusion</strong><br>
                        Your UMSU wants to ensure that all students have access to an equitable and inclusive
                        experience. Your UMSU is committed to increasing the number of
                        gender neutral washrooms on all campuses and ensuring that more washrooms have access to
                        free sanitary products. Both on and off campus, women continue to be underrepresented in
                        leadership roles - especially in male-dominated fields such as business, science and
                        engineering. My team and I will prioritize investing in programs that help womyn find their
                        voices,
                        challenge gender stereotypes, and discover and celebrate their strength.</h3>

                    <h3><strong>Increased Pathways For International Students To Join the Workforce</strong><br>
                        International students bring unique perspectives and culture to campus - even while paying 3x
                        the tuition as domestic students. Your UMSU wants to make sure international students have
                        the proper supports needed to thrive. In the past, UMSU has worked with student unions across
                        Canada to bring a petition to the floor of the House of Commons and lobby legislators to fast
                        track international students into the workforce by allowing co-op work hours to count towards
                        permanent residency requirements. This year we will concert our efforts to have this regulation
                        changed. In order to ensure this has the largest impact possible, we will work with
                        government to eliminate red tape by making international study visas transferable to co-op
                        terms.</h3>

                            Your UMSU understands that leadership opportunities are important for your time on campus
                            and beyond. We will implement professional development workshops on event planning,
                            marketing strategy and sponsorship for leaders across campus to ensure all groups are
                            providing the highest quality programming possible to our students at the University of
                            Manitoba.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Re-Invent Frosh And Welcome Week</strong><br>
                            In our centennial year students deserve a memorable celebration. Your UMSU will move Frosh
                            to a better off-campus venue and bring in big names so that it is an experience for all
                            students.
                            Your UMSU is committed to enriching your student experience which is why welcome week will
                            be filled with giveaways, contests, information sessions and a speed-mentorship event to
                            connect incoming students with leaders across campus. Welcome Week will leave students
                            feeling prepared and excited for what they year has in store.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Advocate For Virtual Student Cards</strong><br>Your UMSU understands that students
                            have
                            enough to worry about as is. This is why we will
                            work with the University to implement virtual student cards for your mobile devices. These
                            will
                            allow students access to the Active Living Centre, pay for food on campus using foodbucks
                            and
                            provide discounts at UMSU businesses. These cards will provide ease and convenience to
                            students all across campus.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Provide A Prep-book Rental System Through UMSU</strong><br>
                            Your UMSU wants all students to pursue their academic dreams without worrying about
                            financial barriers. This is why we will provide a professional program prep-book rental
                            system
                            through the UMSU front desk. Students will have access to MCAT, LSAT & GMAT books free of
                            charge. We will also work with faculties to partner on information sessions for
                            professional
                            programs.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Improve The Hamper Program</strong><br>
                            Every year the demand for our Christmas hampers increase and we want to ensure all students
                            have access to this program. Your UMSU will adopt a new sponsorship strategy to include the
                            wider business community to be involved with this campaign. We will also implement an
                            improved sign-up, sponsorship, and volunteer forum to ensure the community is aware and
                            involved with this great cause!</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Rebrand and Refresh the UMSU Businesses</strong><br>
                            Being an international student that has stayed in residence, I know that students deserve a
                            place
                            to feel comfortable on campus. Degrees and The HUB have been that place for many students,
                            and as your VP Finance and Operations, I want to refresh these spaces by renovating the
                            interior and revamping systems by initiating a more computerized autonomous system which
                            will
                            make ordering food more efficient.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Implement and Expand Participatory Budgeting</strong><br>
                            Students want a say in how their money is spent. Want Proof? Check out the hundreds of
                            submissions you sent our way this fall as to how UMSU should spend $20,000 of our budget in
                            our inaugural participatory budgeting initiative. Your UMSU will complete the
                            implementation of
                            this year’s Participatory Budgeting project, and raise the amount available to you to
                            $50,000,
                            which includes a $20,000 participatory budget for Bannatyne Students.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Budget Funding to Bannatyne and Inner City Support Programming System</strong><br>We’ve
                            heard from our members at Bannatyne that they would like more than a few weeks of
                            wraps and pasta from UMSU executives. This year, we are promising to step up our game. We
                            will implement a support program budget for our Bannatyne and Inner City campus students,
                            where we will provide resources, programming and even more food. All UMSU members
                            deserve the same level of support and we will make this a reality.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Advocate For Better International Healthcare Policy For The Upcoming Year</strong><br>
                            After the provincial government removed international healthcare at the end of the last
                            academic year, the University stepped in to subsidise the cost for the first year of
                            transition.
                            However, international students are facing the highest fee increase with the cap set at 5%
                            +
                            C.P.I (last year C.P.I was 1.6%) Students are facing a higher tuition increase and Your
                            UMSU
                            will lobby the university to extend the subsidy period for another year to help
                            international
                            students during consecutive max tuition increases.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Advocate For A More Affordable UMSU Healthcare Plan</strong><br>
                            This is our final year in our current extended healthcare contract, and many students have
                            enjoyed the access to affordable secondary healthcare the program provides; But that
                            doesn’t
                            mean we can’t do better. I will lead negotiations with current healthcare provider and
                            initiate an
                            RFP to determine the best value contract. I realise that being a student is strainias and i
                            want to
                            make the student experience more affordable.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Establish A Multi-Faith Space On Campus</strong><br>It is evident that at this
                            university,
                            year after year, diversity in the demographic continues to
                            grow. In a multicultural community it is important to have spaces and places where everyone
                            feels safe and supported. For many students, that means we need a place where students can
                            practice their faith on campus. That is why i will work in tandem with the university to
                            bring a
                            multi-faith space to campus. So no matter where you’re from or how your practice your
                            faith, you
                            feel like you have a home at this University.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Mental Health Peer Support Call For Action</strong><br>
                            Your UMSU believes that the safety of students is a priority and on campus they deserve to
                            feel
                            secure in the face of crisis. This is why we will implement a call to action for our
                            student
                            faculty
                            leaders to receive peer support training and encourage their student bodies to participate
                            in
                            Mental Health First Aid sessions facilitated by UMSU’s partnership with the Mood Disorders
                            Association of Manitoba, available during campaign weeks. Your UMSU will also provide
                            spaces and resources for these classes all year round, to ensure that our campus can become
                            even more conscious in terms of support, crisis and response.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Student Group Spotlight Program & Year-End Recognition Gala</strong><br>
                            Student leaders put in endless hours into initiatives that benefit the social, academic and
                            cultural
                            well-being of our campus. Your UMSU wants to acknowledge their hard work by utilizing ACE
                            meetings to vote on student group projects that deserve recognition. These groups will
                            receive a
                            prize, a feature on UMSU social media and a month-long slide on the University Centre
                            televisions to help promote their accomplishments. We also want to give back to members of
                            faculty student associations by hosting a Year-End gala to honour the amazing work that
                            they
                            do for our campus, and provide awards to acknowledge their work.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Improved Accessibility To Student Counselling</strong><br>Your UMSU understands
                            that when
                            you are waiting to receive mental health counsel, the last
                            thing that you need are long wait times. This is why we will work with the Student
                            Counselling
                            Centre to decrease wait time so that students can receive the help that they deserve when
                            they
                            need it most and to advocate for a more efficient, effective and personalized system for
                            students.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>International Student Canadian Tours During Reading Week</strong><br>
                            With family so far away, it is often tough to travel back home when you are only given a
                            few
                            days during breaks in the school year. This is why Your UMSU wants to improve the
                            international student experience by partnering with travel companies to create an
                            affordable
                            option for you to not only explore Canada and to see what our beautiful country has to
                            offer, but
                            to strengthen the bonds within our intentional community more than ever.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Enhanced Peer Tutoring</strong><br>
                            Your UMSU understands that keeping up with never-ending course material can be
                            overwhelming. This is why we will enhance your peer tutoring experience so that you don’t
                            have
                            to bear the burden alone. Your UMSU plans to do this by implementing Nimbus campaign days
                            to educate students on what the service offers, through hosting pop-up speed-tutoring
                            events as
                            well as incentives such as contests for free sessions and a peer tutor spotlight. We will
                            also vet
                            and employ more students by making applications more streamlined and accessible for all.</h3>

                        <h3><strong>Expanded Indigenous Awareness Campaign</strong><br>Being an educational institution
                            on
                            Treaty 1 territory, Your UMSU believes that reconciliation
                            and the proper informative campaigns for indigenous issues should be a priority. Working in
                            collaboration with indigenous student groups,student leaders and the Indigenous Centre, we
                            would provide more supports and resources to grow the month-long awareness campaign. Your
                            UMSU wants to strengthen the impact made by devoting donations, promotional work and
                            outreach to these important initiatives across your campus</h3>
